          Node4

There is node4 which is connected to node2 through other interface. 
Node1 is a packet generator and generate pkts of multiple types all destined to node3. 
Node2 is a router which will forward all such packets to destination node3. Node3 runs respective applications to process packet of specific types. 
Node2 has an additional functionality to route the copy of packets it is forwarding from node1 to node3 to node4 also. 
Node4 has the one application A which is capable of recieving all types of packets and logg them. After logging, A handsover the packet to repective processes to handle the packet processing.
